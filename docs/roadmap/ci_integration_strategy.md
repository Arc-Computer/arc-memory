# Arc Memory CI Integration Strategy

## Vision

Arc Memory is not just another "memory layer." It is the risk-aware world-model for code: a temporal graph + RL engine (trajectories) that agents query to predict blast-radius, security vulnerabilities, and performance regressions before a merge. While competing memory stores retrieve facts, Arc simulates consequences.

> **Core Thesis**: Whoever controls a live, trustworthy memory of the system controls the pace at which they can safely unleash autonomy.

As AI generates exponentially more code, the critical bottleneck shifts from *generation* to *understanding, provenance, and coordination*. The CI environment represents the most data-rich opportunity to build this world model, as it sees everything in the system: code changes, test results, build artifacts, and agent interactions.

## CI Integration Goals

1. **Continuous Knowledge Graph Building**: Automatically update the knowledge graph with each commit, PR, and test run
2. **Risk Assessment**: Predict blast radius and potential issues before code is merged
3. **Agent Coordination**: Enable multiple agents to work together with a shared understanding
4. **Performance Optimization**: Capture agent traces to understand and improve performance
5. **Provenance Tracking**: Record why every change was made and by whom (human or agent)

## Framework-Agnostic Approach

Drawing inspiration from NVIDIA's AIQ framework, our CI integration will be framework-agnostic, treating all components as function calls to enable true composability. This allows teams to use Arc Memory regardless of their agent usage level.

### For Agent-Heavy Teams

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow for agent-heavy teams
name: Arc Memory Agent Integration

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  arc-memory-analysis:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      - name: Set up Arc Memory
        uses: arc-computer/setup-arc-memory@v1
      
      - name: Build Knowledge Graph
        run: arc build --github --auto-refresh
      
      - name: Run Agent-Based Analysis
        uses: arc-computer/arc-agent-analysis@v1
        with:
          agent-framework: langchain # or llamaindex, autogen, etc.
          analysis-type: blast-radius
          model: gpt-4-1106-preview
      
      - name: Post Analysis Results
        uses: arc-computer/arc-pr-comment@v1
        with:
          comment-type: blast-radius-prediction
```

### For Traditional Teams

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow for teams with minimal agent usage
name: Arc Memory Integration

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  arc-memory-analysis:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      - name: Set up Arc Memory
        uses: arc-computer/setup-arc-memory@v1
      
      - name: Build Knowledge Graph
        run: arc build --github
      
      - name: Analyze PR Impact
        run: arc why --pr ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --output-format markdown > analysis.md
      
      - name: Post Analysis Results
        uses: arc-computer/arc-pr-comment@v1
        with:
          comment-file: analysis.md
```

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. GitHub Actions Components

1. **Setup Action**: `arc-computer/setup-arc-memory@v1`
   - Installs Arc Memory
   - Configures authentication
   - Sets up necessary environment

2. **Analysis Actions**:
   - `arc-computer/arc-agent-analysis@v1`: For agent-based analysis
   - `arc-computer/arc-blast-radius@v1`: For blast radius prediction
   - `arc-computer/arc-security-scan@v1`: For security vulnerability detection

3. **Reporting Actions**:
   - `arc-computer/arc-pr-comment@v1`: Posts analysis results as PR comments
   - `arc-computer/arc-dashboard-update@v1`: Updates Arc Memory dashboard

### 2. Plugin Architecture Extensions

Building on Arc Memory's existing plugin architecture, we'll add CI-specific plugins:

```python
class CIPlugin(Protocol):
    def get_name(self) -> str: ...
    def get_supported_ci_systems(self) -> List[str]: ...
    def process_ci_event(self, event_type: str, payload: Dict[str, Any]) -> None: ...
```

This allows for extensibility to different CI systems beyond GitHub Actions.

### 3. Agent Trace Collection

For teams using agents, we'll collect agent traces to improve the world model:

```python
class AgentTraceCollector:
    def __init__(self, repo_path: str):
        self.repo_path = repo_path
        self.traces = []
    
    def record_agent_action(self, agent_id: str, action: str, context: Dict[str, Any]):
        """Record an agent action for later analysis."""
        self.traces.append({
            "agent_id": agent_id,
            "action": action,
            "context": context,
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
        })
    
    def save_traces(self):
        """Save traces to the knowledge graph."""
        # Implementation
```

## RL Environment Integration

The CI environment provides the perfect opportunity to train RL models on code changes and their outcomes:

1. **State**: The codebase state before a change
2. **Action**: The code change (PR)
3. **Reward**: Build success, test results, performance metrics
4. **Next State**: The codebase after the change

This allows Arc Memory to learn from historical changes and predict outcomes for new changes.

```python
class CodebaseRLEnvironment:
    def __init__(self, repo_path: str):
        self.repo_path = repo_path
        self.knowledge_graph = load_knowledge_graph(repo_path)
    
    def get_state(self, commit_hash: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get the state of the codebase at a specific commit."""
        return self.knowledge_graph.get_state_at_commit(commit_hash)
    
    def get_action(self, pr_number: int) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get the action (code change) from a PR."""
        return self.knowledge_graph.get_pr_changes(pr_number)
    
    def get_reward(self, pr_number: int) -> float:
        """Calculate the reward for a PR based on build success, test results, etc."""
        # Implementation
    
    def predict_outcome(self, current_state: Dict[str, Any], proposed_action: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Predict the outcome of a proposed code change."""
        # Implementation using trained RL model
```
