## Week 3 Priorities

### 1. Testing on Medium and Large Repositories

This is the highest priority to identify any performance issues early and provide valuable data for benchmarks.

#### Step 1.1: Medium Repository Testing (Flask)
- Clone the Flask repository (~5,000 commits)
- Run `arc build` and measure:
  - Build time
  - Database size
  - Node and edge counts
  - Memory usage
- Run incremental builds and verify correctness
- Run trace history queries and measure latency

#### Step 1.2: Large Repository Testing (Django)
- Clone the Django repository (~30,000 commits)
- Run `arc build` and measure:
  - Build time
  - Database size
  - Node and edge counts
  - Memory usage
- Identify and address any performance bottlenecks
- Test trace history queries with different file paths

#### Step 1.3: Performance Analysis
- Compare results across small, medium, and large repositories
- Identify scaling factors and bottlenecks
- Update performance benchmarks documentation
- Make recommendations for optimization

### 2. Comprehensive Test Coverage

Ensuring strong test coverage is essential for reliability and maintainability.

#### Step 2.1: Unit Tests
- Add tests for the plugin architecture
- Add tests for the data model
- Add tests for the build process
- Add tests for the CLI commands

#### Step 2.2: Integration Tests
- Create tests that verify the end-to-end flow
- Test with real repositories
- Test incremental builds

#### Step 2.3: Coverage Measurement
- Set a target of 80% code coverage (as specified in the PRD)
- Identify and fill coverage gaps
- Add tests for edge cases

### 3. PyPI Package Publishing

Making the package available through PyPI is a key deliverable.

#### Step 3.1: Package Preparation
- Ensure all dependencies are correctly specified in pyproject.toml
- Update version number to reflect the current state
- Verify package metadata is correct

#### Step 3.2: Build and Publish
- Build the package using the publish.sh script
- Publish to PyPI
- Verify installation works with pip and uv

#### Step 3.3: Documentation
- Update installation instructions in the README
- Add badges for PyPI version and Python version

### 4. Performance Optimization

Based on findings from repository testing, optimize performance.

#### Step 4.1: Trace History Algorithm
- Verify the trace history algorithm meets the 200ms latency target
- Optimize for larger repositories
- Add caching for git blame results

#### Step 4.2: Database Optimization
- Add indexes to improve query performance
- Optimize SQL queries
- Implement efficient bulk operations

### 5. Documentation Updates

Ensure all features are well-documented.

#### Step 5.1: CLI Command Documentation
- Document the `arc trace` command
- Update documentation for the `arc build` command
- Add examples for common use cases

#### Step 5.2: Developer Documentation
- Document the plugin architecture implementation
- Add guidelines for creating custom plugins
- Document the data model

### 6. CI Integration

Set up CI workflows for automated builds and testing.

#### Step 6.1: GitHub Actions Workflow
- Create a workflow for incremental builds
- Test the workflow with real repositories
- Document the CI integration
