# Final Preparation Plan Before Publishing

This document outlines the highest-value tasks to complete before publishing the Arc Memory package to PyPI.

## 1. Documentation Completeness (Highest Value, Moderate Effort)

### API Documentation
- Ensure all public functions and classes are well-documented
- Document return types and exceptions
- Add docstrings to all public methods
- Verify that docstrings follow a consistent format

### Usage Examples
- Add examples for common use cases:
  - Building a knowledge graph from scratch
  - Performing incremental builds
  - Tracing history for a specific file and line
  - Creating and using custom plugins
- Include code snippets that can be copied and pasted

### CLI Command Documentation
- Document all CLI commands:
  - `arc auth` - Authentication commands
  - `arc build` - Building the knowledge graph
  - `arc trace` - Tracing history
  - `arc doctor` - Checking the graph status
- Document all command options and flags
- Include example commands for common scenarios

### Plugin Development Guide
- Document the plugin architecture
- Provide a step-by-step guide for creating custom plugins
- Include a template for new plugins
- Document the plugin registration process

Documentation is critical because it's the first thing users will see. Without clear documentation, users won't be able to use the package effectively, regardless of how well-tested it is.

## 2. Critical Tests (High Value, Focused Effort)

### Core Functionality Tests
Focus on testing the most critical paths:
- **Graph Building Process**
  - Test building from scratch
  - Test incremental builds
  - Test with different repository structures
- **Trace History Algorithm**
  - Test with different file types
  - Test with different line numbers
  - Test with different repository structures
- **Plugin Architecture**
  - Test plugin discovery
  - Test plugin registration
  - Test plugin execution

### Integration Tests
- Add a few key integration tests that verify the end-to-end flow:
  - Clone a repository, build the graph, trace history
  - Test with a real repository structure
  - Verify that the results match expectations

Rather than aiming for 80% coverage immediately, focus on the most critical functionality first. This gives you the best return on investment for your testing effort.

## 3. Package Verification (Medium Value, Low Effort)

### Local Installation Test
- Build the package locally
- Install the package in a clean environment
- Verify that all commands work as expected

### Dependency Verification
- Ensure all dependencies are correctly specified in pyproject.toml
- Verify minimum versions for all dependencies
- Check for any conflicting dependencies

### Version Check
- Verify the version number is appropriate (following semantic versioning)
- Update the version number in all relevant files
- Ensure the version is consistent throughout the package

This is relatively quick to do and provides confidence that the package will install correctly.

## Rationale

This plan focuses on the highest-value tasks first, ensuring that users can understand and use the package effectively. By prioritizing documentation and critical tests, we maximize the return on investment for our effort while ensuring a quality initial release.

The approach is pragmatic, recognizing that we can continue to improve test coverage and documentation in subsequent releases. The goal is to provide a solid foundation that users can build upon, rather than trying to achieve perfection in the initial release.
