# Arc Memory SDK - Issue #1 Fix Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to address [Issue #1: Missing Packages & Installation](https://github.com/Arc-Computer/arc-memory/issues/1) in the Arc Memory SDK.

## Problem Statement
During the implementation of an Arc Memory MCP Server, several issues were encountered with the `arc-memory` Python SDK:
1. **Missing Dependencies**: The package has dependencies that aren't automatically installed
2. **Database Access and Initialization**: Insufficient handling for cases where the database doesn't exist
3. **Error Handling**: Implementation doesn't handle initialization errors properly
4. **Documentation Gaps**: Lack of comprehensive information about dependencies and setup

## Action Plan

### 1. Update Package Dependencies
- [x] Review current dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
- [x] Ensure all required dependencies are properly specified with version constraints
- [x] Organize dependencies into core and optional groups
- [x] Update package metadata to ensure automatic installation of dependencies

### 2. Improve Error Handling and Database Initialization
- [ ] Enhance database initialization process in `arc_memory/sql/db.py`
- [ ] Add validation checks at startup
- [ ] Implement clear error messages for missing dependencies or database
- [ ] Add graceful degradation for common failure scenarios
- [ ] Implement proper logging throughout the SDK

### 3. Create a Test Mode
- [ ] Implement test mode that can run without connecting to an actual database
- [ ] Add mock data functionality for testing
- [ ] Create configuration option to enable test mode
- [ ] Update relevant functions to check for test mode and return mock data

### 4. Update Documentation
- [ ] Expand SDK documentation with:
  - [ ] Complete list of dependencies
  - [ ] Instructions for setting up a test environment
  - [ ] Guidance on handling common errors
  - [ ] Examples of using the SDK in different contexts
  - [ ] Troubleshooting guide for common issues

### 5. Add Validation Tests
- [ ] Create validation tests for the Arc Memory environment
- [ ] Include tests for dependency checking
- [ ] Add tests for database initialization and error handling
- [ ] Ensure CI/CD tests cover different environments

### 6. Testing and Verification
- [ ] Test all changes in different environments
- [ ] Verify package installs correctly with all dependencies
- [ ] Ensure error messages are clear and helpful
- [ ] Validate that test mode works as expected
- [ ] Check that documentation is comprehensive and accurate

### 7. Create Pull Request
- [ ] Submit PR with all changes
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass
- [ ] Address review comments
- [ ] Update issue with resolution

## Progress Tracking
